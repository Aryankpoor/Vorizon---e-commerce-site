## Supported Versions

Only issues related with the latest version of the repository will be entertained since the final version is the only version which impacts the end user's experience. Also there is no backend so previous version vulnerability won't matter. But , if there is a vulnerability which found it's way through previous versions , then welcome to the part

## Reporting a Vulnerability

You can report vulnerability by simply raising an issue. No questions asked.
